# 🎵 YT Audio Player: The Ultimate Lightweight YouTube Audio Experience

## 🤩 Why settle for less? Behold, the Most Ridiculously Lightweight YouTube Audio Player Ever

Are you a gamer who wants to blast your favorite YouTube playlist while fragging noobs, but your browser eats more RAM than Chrome on a caffeine binge? Tired of apps that turn your potato PC into a baked potato? Want to listen to music while running a game, a video call, AND 37 Chrome tabs? **This script LAUGHS at your resource limits!**

**YT Audio Player** is so light, you’ll wonder if it’s even running. It’s like the ninja of audio players—silent, invisible, and deadly (to bloatware). No temp files, no drama, no nonsense. Just pure, instant music, even on a 10-year-old laptop that wheezes when you open Notepad.

## 🚀 What is this?

**YT Audio Player** is the *fastest*, *lightest*, and *most reliable* YouTube audio player for Windows (and beyond)! It lets you search, browse, and stream YouTube audio with near-zero CPU/RAM usage. No temp files, no bloat, no drama—just pure, instant music and talk, even on ancient laptops!

## ✨ Features That Will Make You Question Reality

- **Blazing Fast Search:** Type a query, get the top 10 results with titles, channels, and durations before you can say "yt-dlp"!
- **Playlist Power:** Paste a playlist link and play every track, skipping with a single keypress. See what’s playing, always! (Your friends will think you’re a wizard.)
- **Direct Link Streaming:** Paste any YouTube link and it just works. No questions asked. No judgment.
- **Interactive Selection:** Pick your favorite from search results—no more guessing! (No more "wrong song" disasters.)
- **Skip & Control:** Press `n` to skip to the next song, or `Ctrl+C` to instantly return to the main menu. (Because you’re in control, always.)
- **Cookies.txt Support:** Got region-locked or age-restricted content? Drop your `cookies.txt` in the folder and you’re in! (Like a VIP pass for YouTube.)
- **Zero Temp Files:** Streams audio directly—no disk clutter, ever. (Marie Kondo would be proud.)
- **Minimal Logging:** Only what you want—toggle debug/info logs for easy troubleshooting. (Or just ignore them, we won’t tell.)
- **Rock-Solid Stability:** Handles errors, bad links, and weird YouTube quirks with grace. (It’s basically unbreakable.)
- **Runs on Potatoes:** Designed for low-resource systems. 8GB RAM? Old CPU? No problem! (Heck, it probably runs on a toaster.)

## 💡 Pro Tips (Because You’re a Power User Now)

- Use `cookies.txt` for private, region-locked, or age-restricted content.
- If you get errors, check `yt_audio_player.log` (if logging is enabled) for full debug info.
- You can change the number of search results by editing `SEARCH_RESULTS` in the script.
- Works great in a terminal multiplexer or as a background music tool while you work or play!

yt-dlp -f bestaudio -o - "ytsearch1:lofi hip hop" | ffplay -i - -nodisp -autoexit
```

### ▶️ Stream a single YouTube video (replace the URL with your video)

```sh
yt-dlp -f bestaudio -o - "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID" | ffplay -i - -nodisp -autoexit
```

### 🎶 Stream a YouTube playlist (replace the URL with your playlist)
